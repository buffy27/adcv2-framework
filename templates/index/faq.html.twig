            <strong id="17">So, what's MY ratio?</strong>
            <p>Look at the top of the page under the ADC logo.</p>
            <p>It's important to distinguish between your overall ratio and the individual ratio on each torrent you may be seeding or leeching. The overall ratio takes into account the total uploaded and downloaded from your account since you joined the site. The individual ratio takes into account those values for the <em>current session</em> of each torrent.</p>
            <p>You may see two symbols instead of a number: "Inf.", which is just an abbreviation for Infinity and means that you have downloaded 0 bytes while uploading a non-zero amount (ul/dl becomes infinity); "---", which should be read as "non-available" and shows up when you have both downloaded and uploaded 0 bytes (ul/dl = 0/0 which is an indeterminate amount).</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="67">What is the minimum ratio I need to have?</strong>
            <p>ADC members are required to maintain at least a minimum share ratio, based on their total amount downloaded. It is solely your responsibility to keep yourself above your minimum required ratio.</p>
            <p>A sliding scale is used to calculate your required ratio, based on your total download amount. The more you download, the higher your required ratio becomes, until you reach the cap of <strong>0.5</strong>. No one is required to maintain a higher ratio than 0.5, regardless of how much they have downloaded.</p>
            <p>The sliding scale uses a ratio factor of 200. Your minimum required ratio is calculated by taking your total download amount (in gigabytes) and dividing it by the scale's ratio factor. For example, if you have downloaded 49 GB, your minimum required ratio will be 49 divided by 200, which equals 0.245.</p>
            <p>If you have downloaded less than 15 GB, you do not yet have any ratio requirements to fulfill. But once you reach 15 GB downloaded, the ratio requirements will immediately take effect.</p>
            <p>Failure to meet your required ratio may result in a warning. If you download too much while you are warned, you will have your download privileges removed, and you will then only be able to download golden torrents. Seeding and uploading new torrents will still be possible however.</p>
            <p>Warned users who upload enough to reach their minimum required ratio will have their warning automatically removed in due time. If their download privileges were removed, those privileges will automatically be restored.</p>
            <p>You will never be banned for simply having a bad ratio. Not even if it takes you months to get above your minimum required ratio.</p>

            <strong id="18">Why is my IP and email address displayed in my profile?</strong>
            <p>Only you and the site staff can view your IP and email address. That information is not shown to regular users.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="20">My IP address is dynamic. How do I stay logged in?</strong>
            <p>ADC uses browser cookies to identify you and keep you logged in. As long as you do not logout or delete your cookies, you will be able to view every page on the site without having to login again, even if your IP has changed since your last visit. If you delete your cookies or logout, you will simply need to login again in order to view any pages.</p>

            <p>Be patient. While the server automatically handles promotions and demotions, they do not occur instantaneously. It may take up to 24 hours for you to be promoted after you have met the requirements for the user class, though promotions and demotions will usually go through much sooner than that.</p>

            <strong id="69">I'm going to be away from my computer for a long period of time, what will happen to my account?</strong>
            <p>If your account is not parked, then it will be automatically deleted from the database after 120 days of inactivity. If your account is parked, then it will be automatically deleted from the database after 240 days of inactivity. If you return or visit the site with your account before that amount of time passes, then the inactivity timer will reset and your account will be fine for another 120 or 240 days (depending on its parked/not-parked status). You can find the account park option near the top of your <a class="altlink" href="<?php echo URL_ROOT . "/profile/ps"; ?>">personal settings page</a>.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that 'activity' is considered a visit to any page and that torrent traffic is not counted as account activity. In order to reset the inactivity timer all you have to do is visit a single page while logged in with your account. If your account is deleted for inactivity, please do not ask the site staff to un-delete it for you. The deletion is performed automatically by the server and, as such, your account cannot be recovered after it has been deleted.</p>

            <strong id="106">What are bonus points?</strong>
            <p>If you're a member of other private trackers, you are probably at least vaguely familiar with the concept of bonus points. For the uninitiated, a bonus point system essentially allows users to earn points that can be redeemed for various rewards, primarily upload credit. </p>
            <p>In our new system, there are two simple ways to earn bonus points: <strong>1.)</strong> by seeding certain qualifying torrents and <strong>2.)</strong> by actively participating in the community. The purpose of the system is severalfold. First, people often abandon older and less active torrents - or avoid downloading them in the first place - because these torrents generally see far less activity than new torrents. We hope to encourage our members to keep seeding these older and less popular torrents by giving them a small reward for their time and effort. Second, new members often grab torrents which do not present good ratio opportunities, and this results in many of these members experiencing ratio troubles that can best be described as <em>frustrating</em>. Our bonus system provides some alternate routes for them to improve their ratio, while at the same time helping to make ADC a better place for everyone. And finally, while we have a good number of active members who regularly download and seed our DVDs, BDs, and soundtracks, the number who frequently participate in the community is quite a bit lower. So one of our principal goals for the system is to promote a wider range of involvement in the ADC community. This includes uploading torrents, commenting on torrents, posting in our forums, and voting on our polls.</p>
            <p>The system is and always will be a work in progress. We will regularly be adding new rewards, tweaking the mechanics of the system, adjusting the number of points dispensed for the various and sundry activities, and fixing any issues that crop up in the meantime.</p>
            <p>We'll be adding additional rewards in the future, with most of the new rewards targeted at members who do not need a ratio boost. Some of these rewards will only benefit the purchaser, while other rewards will benefit the purchaser as well as other members. So even if you don't find any of the current rewards appealing, you may still want to accumulate points so you can purchase future rewards.</p>
            <p>Note: Asking for other members to send you bonus points anywhere on the site or off the site is not allowed. This includes sending PMs to others asking them to send you points. This behaviour is considered begging for points and it will be met with punishment.</p>

        <h2 id="3" class="mt-4">Stats - <a href="#top">Top</a></h2>
        <div class="fancy-container p-3">
            <strong id="27">Most common reasons for stats not updating</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The server is majorly overloaded and/or unresponsive. Check the tracker status for the ADC torrents you have running, as more detailed information can sometimes be found there. Just try to keep your client running - <em>without restarting it</em> - until the server comes back online. That will give you the best chance of having your stats counted once the server is online again.<br />
                    (Flooding the server with consecutive manual updates will not fix the problem. In fact, that will probably make the problem worse and may result in you being banned from the tracker.)</li>
                <li>You are using a buggy or poorly-written BitTorrent client. If you want to use a weird client or an experimental version of a popular client, such as an alpha or beta release, you do so at your own risk. These clients are not in common use for a reason.</li>
                <li>You have not bathed in weeks. Put down the anime, take a shower, and then check ADC again.</li>
                <li>One of the server hamsters has died and is clogging up their wheel. Once her sisters finish devouring her remains and take a nap, they will get the wheel moving again and the server will come back up.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <strong id="28">Best practices to ensure your stats are counted</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If a torrent you are currently leeching or seeding is not listed on your profile, just wait a while for it to show up again or perform a manual tracker update.</li>
                <li>Make sure you exit your client properly, so that the tracker receives "event=completed" for your torrents. An example of properly exiting your client is going through File-&gt;Exit and then waiting until the client has completely exited before shutting down your computer or disconnecting from the Internet. If you just shutdown your system or yank out the network cable, your client may not have time to both properly close and to send your torrents' final stats to the tracker.</li>
                <li>If the tracker is offline, do not stop seeding your torrents. As long as the tracker is back up before you close the client, your stats should update properly.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <strong id="29">May I use any BitTorrent client?</strong>
            <p>No, there are some clients that are banned and some that may not work. For an up-to-date list, please see this <a class="altlink" href="/forums">forum post (pending)</a>. You are also advised to avoid any experimental or beta versions of clients, as they often are buggy and may not report your stats correctly.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="30">Why is a torrent I'm leeching/seeding listed several times in my profile?</strong>
            <p>If for some reason, such as a PC crash or a frozen client, your client exits improperly and you restart it, any torrents running in your client will be given a new peer_id by the client. This causes the tracker to treat them as new torrents, which is why they will be listed in your profile alongside the old torrents, like duplicate torrents. Since your client is no longer controlling the old torrent sessions, the tracker will never receive an "event=completed" or an "event=stopped" for the old torrents. As a result they will remain listed on your profile until they surpass the time-out threshold, at which point they will be removed automatically.</p>
            <p>If this happens to you, you do not need to PM a staff member about the issue. The tracker handles these situations automatically, so just be patient and the old torrent listings will disappear from your profile within the next hour or two. Your stats will still be counted correctly.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="31">I've finished or cancelled a torrent. Why is it still listed in my profile?</strong>
            <p>Some clients, do not report properly to the tracker when a torrent is stopped or finishes downloading. When this happens, the tracker will continue to wait for an "event=stopped" or an "event=completed" message. However, since the client never sends this message to the tracker the torrent will continue to be listed on your profile as seeding or leeching - until the session for the torrent surpasses the time-out threshold. Once that happens the tracker will automatically remove the old session and the listing will disappear from your profile. In the meantime you should just ignore the now defunct listing.</p>
            <p>If this happens to you very frequently you may want to switch to a better torrent client.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="33">Can I login from different computers? Even if they have different IPs?</strong>
            <p>The tracker uses the passkey system, which means that your torrents are connected to your account via your passkey. Every torrent's passkey is unique, so you do not have to worry about your torrents not working if you downloaded them from another computer or if your ISP dynamically assigns IP addresses. Any torrent file you download from ADC while logged in will contain your unique passkey, allowing you to download the files from one computer and start them on another.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="78">I have access to a seedbox or other fast line. Can I use that on ADC?</strong>
            <p>Yes, that's not a problem. Many of our users with limited bandwidth use a seedbox or other connections in order to boost their torrenting ability. Although be aware of the shared seedboxes, if someone on the same IP address commits violation and that is being banned you will share the faith of the cheater as well.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="79">Can I seed/leech from multiple computers (e.g. work and home) at the same time? Will it all be counted?</strong>
            <br><br>You are not allowed to seed and/or leech torrents from multiple computers with your account, even if their IPs are different. Leeching allowed from only one client at the time. In exception is being made for uploads, regular users who uploaded the torrent can seed from two clients, <span class="bold blue">Uploaders</span> from three.<br>
            <br />

            <strong id="105">Why do my ADC stats differ from the stats shown in my torrent client?</strong><a name="#105" id="105"></a>
            <p>Sometimes, the downloaded and uploaded amounts you see listed on ADC for a particular torrent will differ from the downloaded and uploaded amounts you see in your torrent client. There is a simple reason for this, and it does not mean that your stats are counted incorrectly.</p>
            <p>The downloaded and uploaded amounts you see listed next to the torrents you are seeding/leeching on your profile (or on a torrent details page next to your username) only refer to the <em>current session</em> of your torrent client. This means it only shows you the stats from the last time you added that torrent to your client, or since you last started your client. This means that if you close your client and open it again, those stats will reset to 0 on ADC, but all the stats are still correctly added to your <em>total</em> downloaded and uploaded stats you see listed on your profile.</p>

            <strong id="82">What are the requirements to upload a torrent?</strong>
            <p>Any user may upload a torrent. There are no official requirements, such as needing to meet a certain minimum upload speed or being a member of a specific user class. Allowing everyone to share what they have is a cornerstone of our community.</p>
            <p>All we ask is that you make sure to seed your upload until <em>at least</em> the first set of leechers have completed their download, and that you abide by the <a class="altlink" href="/upload">upload rules</a> - especially that you try to avoid uploading a duplicate torrent. If you're not familiar with the concept already, know that you can usually find all previous uploads for a film or series by searching using the <a class="altlink" href="#71">IMDB tt code</a>. Make sure that you do at least that much searching before uploading a torrent, so that you do not waste your time making and uploading a torrent that will just wind up being deleted.</p>
            <p>Also, dedicate as much bandwidth as you can to your upload, especially if you have limited upstream bandwidth. Remember that slow speeds can be frustrating when you're downloading something, particularly when you see that the uploader is actively seeding a dozen other torrents. So put yourself in the leechers' shoes and pause or temporarily stop your other torrents, if you can, until you have finished uploading your torrent. You may want to mention your slow upload speed at the bottom of your torrent description as well. That way no one will be surprised to find the download taking more than a few hours. Maximum amount of time that can be spent on the torrent upload is five days.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="111">What file formats are allowed to be uploaded to ADC?</strong>
            <p>Only DVDs (.iso or video_ts format), Blu-ray discs (.iso or bdmv format), HD UHD (bdmv format), Asian movie, anime soundtracks and drama CD's are allowed to be uploaded. Encodes (.avi, .mkv, .mp4, .ogm, etc.) are <strong>not allowed</strong>.</p>

            <p class="big"><strong id="107">Everything to know about batches</strong></p>
            <p class="big"><strong><u>What is a batch torrent?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A batch is a torrent that include multiple discs of a series. For example: a torrent that includes all seven volumes of the 'Cowboy Bebop' series is a batch torrent. Batches are preferred over individual volume uploads in almost all cases because they have several advantages over individual volumes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="big"><strong><u>Why should I upload discs as a batch instead of separately?</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Batch torrents tend to stay seeded longer than individual torrents, which means the torrent stays available longer.</li>
                <li>As long as a batch is seeded, the entire season/series is available to be downloaded. When discs are uploaded separately, the moment any one of them goes unseeded, downloading the entire series is not possible anymore.</li>
                <li>Batches save work for the members searching for the series; they do not have to browse through dozens of torrents to find all the discs of the series. With a batch torrent, everything is together in one place.</li>
                <li>The discs in a batch torrent can still be downloaded separately. This is a feature offered by almost all torrent clients.</li>
                <li>Batches are more likely to be silvered and/or spotlighted by the staff or other ADC members.</li>
                <li>Do not upload batches if your connection speed will not allow you to complete upload in five days.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="big"><strong><u>General</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to upload a series to which you have all the discs, you must upload it as a batch. Depending on the size of the discs, you can upload season batches or a batch of the entire series.</li>
                <li>If you are unable to upload a complete batch, you should still upload as many discs together as you can. For example, if you only have the first 4 of 8 discs of a series, you should upload the 4 discs as a batch instead of uploading them separately.</li>
                <li>Discs uploaded separately must be uploaded at least a week apart. This is to ensure the browse page does not get flooded with similar uploads. If you think you need an exemption, <a class="altlink" href="/staff">contact the staff</a>.</li>
                <li>Batch torrents should not exceed a certain size. For example, a 600 GB torrent is too big for most members to download at once and most seedboxes cannot handle it. Ask a staff member if you are unsure about the size of an upload.</li>
                <li>Newly-released "box sets" are allowed to be uploaded, as long as the whole season has not been fully released yet. If the whole season has already been released, the batch should include the entire season. If the whole season has not been released yet, these box sets can be uploaded individually, but the box set must be uploaded as one torrent; discs in such box sets are not allowed to be uploaded separately. If you think you need an exemption, contact the staff.</li>
                <li>Only series should be uploaded as batches. Movies (such as trilogies, or all of a director or actor's films) should be uploaded separately. The rule of thumb is: if there is a high chance that a member will not want the entire batch, then it should not be uploaded as a batch.</li>
                <li>Batches should include scans, case covers, included art if available.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="big"><strong><u>Consolidating (Merging) Individual Torrents Into a Batch</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consolidating multiple torrents already uploaded on ADC into a batch should be looked at on a case-by-case basis. If some (or all) of the individual torrents are dead or badly seeded, uploading a batch is allowed. If all of the individual torrents are well-seeded, the staff will decide if a batch is appropriate. The age and number of torrents, how well-seeded they are, and how well-made they are, will all be taken into consideration when deciding if a batch should be uploaded.</li>
                <li>When consolidating existing torrents into a batch, we strongly recommend that you have the files in the batch match (hash-check) the files in the individual torrents. This allows the seeders of the individual torrents to seed the new batch, either partially or fully, without having to download anything. The staff reserves the right to delete batches that do not meet this condition if another member is willing to upload a batch that hash-checks with the individual torrents.</li>
                <li>Once a consolidated batch has been uploaded, the individual torrents may be deleted in order to reduce clutter in the torrent listings.</li>
                <li>A batch torrent is expected to include any fixes that have been uploaded. For example, if you want to upload a batch of six individual volumes and a patch is available that fixes some spelling mistakes in the subtitles of one of those volumes, then the batch is expected to include an already-patched copy of that volume instead of the original volume.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="big"><strong><u>Batches Should Not Include</u></strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must not upload series and movies together in a single torrent, even if the movie is related to the series. Movies must be uploaded separately. For example, a batch containing the 'Cowboy Bebop' series should not contain the 'Cowboy Bebop' movie.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <strong id="83">I uploaded a torrent but I'm not listed as seeding it, and my client shows a 404 or 4xx error for the torrent?</strong>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>Short answer:</strong></dt>
                <dd>You forgot to download and use the torrent file from your torrent's details page.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Longer answer:</strong></dt>
                <dd>After you upload a torrent the server makes some changes, such as adding passkeys, and if you try to seed using the original torrent file you will see an HTTP 404 error (or 4xx error) as the tracker status for the torrent in your client.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>You don't need to re-upload the torrent to fix the problem, as there's nothing wrong with your torrent. Just remove the torrent from your client, download the torrent file from the details page (just as you normally would when downloading a), set the save location to match wherever you have the files saved on your computer, and finally start the torrent. It should hash check for a while and then begin seeding. If the torrent immediately starts downloading and/or you're listed as having 0% completed, then you set the save location for the torrent in your client to the wrong place. Remove the torrent and try again, this time making sure the save path is set correctly.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="84">I tried to upload a torrent but I got a "dictionary is missing key(s)" message from the server. Buh?</strong>
            <p>That error message means that there was a problem with the announce URL in the torrent file you created. The announce URL must be <strong><?php echo URL_ROOT; ?>/announce</strong> with no spaces or other characters surrounding the URL.</p>
            <p>To fix this problem, recreate the torrent file and make sure that you have the correct announce URL entered. In rare cases it is possible that copy-and-pasting the URL from the web page will result in extra characters being copied, so if you copy-and-pasted the URL before and that failed, try manually typing it into your client.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="85">I have a non-Japanese animated film. In which category does it belong?</strong>
            <p>All torrents for the film belong in the category representing the film's country of origin, just as with non-animated films from that country. For example, the film <a class="altlink" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0302758/">My Beautiful Girl, Mari</a>, which is an animated film from South Korea, belongs in the Korea category.</p>
            <p>Only Japanese animated films and series belong in the Anime category, as the commonly understood definition for anime is Japan-centric. Keeping non-Japanese animated films out of the Anime category helps to cut down on confusion.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="86">Can I upload an Asian version of a Western film?</strong>
            <p>No. Only films from Asian countries are allowed on ADC. Having a Japanese dub on your <a class="altlink" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/">Back to the Future</a> DVD does not make it an Asian film.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="87">How about Western movies with well-known Asian actors?</strong>
            <p>Again, only films from Asian countries are allowed on ADC. It does not matter who is starring in the film - a Western film is still a Western film. <a class="altlink" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120812/">Rush Hour</a> and <a class="altlink" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0271027/">Kiss of the Dragon</a> are not Asian films. <em>Do not upload them here!</em></p>
            <br />

            <strong id="92">Why do I show up as a leecher with 0% completed on a torrent I uploaded?</strong>
            <p>This is because you have set your BitTorrent client to look in the wrong location for your torrent's files (or for the wrong file), leading it to believe that you do not have any part of the file(s) completed. Remove all listings of the torrent from your client, download the .torrent file from the details page again and open it in your client, then make sure to set the save location to wherever you have the files saved on your computer, and finally start the torrent. Your client should spend a few minutes hash checking the file and then begin seeding.</p>
            <p>If your client immediately starts trying to download the torrent or if the completion percentage never moves past 0%, then the wrong save location was specified. A common source of confusion with some clients, such as Azureus, is that you need to specify the parent directory of where your files are saved, rather than the actual directory of the files. For example, if you have your DVD files saved in the directory <tt>C:\Movie</tt> and you choose that directory as the save location, then your client may look in the directory <tt>C:\Movie<strong>\Movie</strong></tt>, see no files associated with the torrent saved there, and decide that you want to download the torrent. The solution in this case is to set the save location for the torrent to the parent directory (<tt>C:\</tt> in this example), which will make your client look for the files in <tt>C:\Movie</tt>, find them, and then hash check and seed the torrent.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="93">Why do I show up as a leecher with 99% completed on my upload? (Or why are the leechers stuck at 99%?)</strong>
            <p>For some reason, one of the pieces in your torrent is not hashing to the same value as what is listed for that piece in the original torrent file. In other words, the data represented by that piece has changed and no longer precisely matches up with the piece as it was when the torrent was created. A single byte change is all it takes for the hash function to return a different value for the piece.</p>
            <p>There are a number of rare events that can cause such a change, including your computer suffering a power failure, your system locking up and/or rebooting while the file was being read from or written to, another process having modified the file (e.g. changing the volume label or altering the subtitle colors), the drive containing the file is failing or is beginning to fail, and so on. It's also possible, though unlikely, that something caused the pieces to hash incorrectly when you created the original .torrent file. Several users have reported this occurring in older versions of Azureus, but no incidents have been reported for other clients.</p>
            <p>In most cases you will need to remake and re-upload the torrent. The only exception would be if you have an <em>unmodified</em> copy of the file(s) available to you, in which case you could just seed using those files and save yourself the trouble of remaking and re-uploading the torrent.</p>
            <p>If you do need to remake and re-upload the torrent and people have already begun downloading it, make sure to use the same filename(s) and directory structure in the new torrent. This will allow the leechers to just grab the data they are missing (only a few MB if they were already at 99.9% completed), rather than having to download everything over again. All that they need to do is stop the old torrent in their client, download the new one, set the save location for the new torrent to the same location as they set for the old one, and then start the new torrent. Their client will hash check up to however much of the torrent they have completed (e.g. 99.9%), download the missing piece(s), and then they'll have a completed copy.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="104">How do I seed my own upload if my download privileges are revoked?</strong>
            <p>If you get warned and you keep leeching, you will get your download privileges revoked. This means you cannot download any torrent on ADC unless it is a golden torrent. There is a misconception that if you decide to upload a torrent while your download privileges are revoked, you won't be able to seed it. This is wrong. Everybody on ADC can upload torrents, even if they're warned and even if they've got their download privileges revoked. If you are having trouble seeding your uploaded torrent, see this FAQ entry: <a class="altlink" href="#92">Why do I show up as a leecher with 0% completed on a torrent I uploaded?</a>.</p>

            <p><a class="altlink" href="/torrents/?searchbox=&search=Search&golden=1">Torrents with a golden chest</a> (<img src="./images/golden.gif">) are considered "free leech", which means downloading them will not affect your download stats, but uploading on a golden torrent will still count towards your upload stats. This means that your ratio can only get better when downloading golden torrents. They are a great place to start for new users worried about their ratio.</p>
            <p>Note: <b>Golden torrents don't give you the right to hit-and-run</b>, you must seed them just as you would any other torrent.</p>

            <p><a class="altlink" href="/torrents/?searchbox=&search=Search&silver=1">Torrents with a silver chest</a> (<img src="./images/silver.gif">) are considered "half leech", which means downloading them will only add half of their download amount to your download stats, but uploading on a silver torrent will still fully count towards your upload stats.</p>
            <p>Note: Only 50% of the download amount is counted for all Blu-ray torrents. In that sense, they act like silver torrents, but they do not have the silver chest. This means that when a Blu-ray torrent has a silver chest icon next to it, only 25% of the download amount is counted.</p>
            <p>Note: <b>Silver torrents don't give you the right to hit-and-run</b>, you must seed on them just as you would any other torrent.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="100">What happens if a torrent I am halfway done downloading loses its golden status?</strong>
            <p>If a torrent you are downloading loses its golden status, then the amount of data you download from the moment the torrent lost its golden status will count towards your ratio. For example, if you are 50% done on a 16 GB torrent, and the torrent ceases to be golden at that point, then the remaining 8 GB will count towards your ratio.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="101">Why do I see a downloaded amount on a torrent in my profile even though it is golden?</strong>
            <p>The downloaded amount you see in your profile next to a golden torrent you are leeching or seeding (or in the Peer list on the torrent description page) is only there for informational purposes. That amount is not added to your total "Downloaded" amount shown in your profile, and thus not counted negatively towards your ratio. The uploaded amount on the torrent, on the other hand, is of course added to your total "Uploaded" amount. You can rest easy knowing that if you download a golden torrent, the stats will never get added to your total "Downloaded" amount as long as that torrent is golden.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="41">Why did an active torrent suddenly disappear?</strong>
            <p>There are two common reasons for this:</p>
            <p>
                (<strong>1</strong>) The torrent may have violated one or more of the <a class="altlink" href="/upload">upload rules</a>.<br />
                (<strong>2</strong>) The uploader may have deleted it because of a problem with the files. A replacement will probably soon be uploaded to take its place.
            </p>
            <br />

            <strong id="42">How do I resume a broken download or reseed something?</strong>
            <p>Open the .torrent file in your BitTorrent client. When you are asked for a location to save the file(s), choose the location of the existing file(s) on your computer. If you set the save location correctly, your client will hash-check the file(s) (this can take several minutes for a single DVD) and once it finishes, you will resume downloading/be reseeding the torrent. If the torrent starts almost immediately after you set the save location without doing any hash-checking, then there was likely a problem and the save location was set to the wrong location. This will cause your client to start downloading the entire torrent. Since you probably don't want that to happen, remove the newly added torrent from your client, and try again from the beginning, making sure you choose the correct save location.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="43">Why do my downloads sometimes stall at 99%?</strong>
            <p>The more pieces you have, the harder it becomes to find peers who have pieces you are missing. That is why your downloads will sometimes slow down or even stall when you have just a few percent left to go. Just be patient and you will get the remaining pieces sooner or later.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="96">Why do I get a "leech slots filled" error?</strong>
            <p>Each user class has a limit on the total number of torrents it can leech at any given time, with the higher classes allowed more leech slots. If you have used all of your leech slots and attempt to start downloading another torrent, the tracker will refuse the connection until one of your leech slots becomes available (e.g. you finish downloading one of the torrents).</p>
            <p>If you recently rebooted your machine and are seeing this error message despite downloading fewer torrents than your slot limit, an improper exit of your client before the reboot might be the cause. Improperly exiting your client can result in some of the old torrents remaining on your profile, leading to multiple listings of them when you restart your client. See <a class="altlink" href="#30">this FAQ entry</a> for more information if this is the case.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="75">Why do I get a "Connection limit exceeded! You may only leech from one location at a time" error?</strong>
            <p>The tracker limits each account to two leeching sessions and three seeding sessions per torrent. You can think of these leeching/seeding sessions as the number of times a torrent is listed as leeching/seeding on your profile. If your client attempts to exceed these limits you will get this error.</p>
            <p>See <a class="altlink" href="#30">this FAQ entry</a> for a likely explanation of why you have multiple sessions for the torrent associated with your account.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="47">Why do I get a "Blocked client" or "Version blocked" error?</strong>
            <p>For various reasons, we are forced to block some clients here at ADC. The list of banned clients is <a class="altlink" href="/forums">forum (pending)</a>. If your client is listed on there please switch to one that is not banned, or upgrade to a newer version if only older versions of it are blocked.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="48">Why do I get an "IOError - [Errno 13] Permission denied" error?</strong>
            <p>IOError means Input-Output Error, and that is an error with your file system. It has nothing to do with the tracker. This error appears in some clients when the client is unable to open a partially downloaded file that's part of the torrent. The most common cause is another process having locked the file, making it impossible for your client to open it. Often this is due to another instance of the client left running in the background or having not been closed properly. Try closing all instances of your client, then open your client again and see if the error message has disappeared. In rare circumstances you may need to restart your computer in order to clear the lock on the file.</p>
            <p>If the above did not fix the problem, then the error is likely due to some corruption in your file system, especially if your drive uses FAT32. A client or computer crash may result in corruption that makes the partially downloaded file unreadable, leading to that error message when your client attempts to open the file. Running a disk checking/repairing utility, such as Scandisk, should fix the corruption.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="103">Can I download only part of a torrent if I don't want all the files?</strong>
            <p>Yes.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="44">What does the message "a piece has failed a hash check" mean and what are hash fails?</strong>
            <p>BitTorrent clients hash check the piece data they receive and perform integrity checking on it in order to verify that the received piece matches the piece as it was in the torrent uploader's original file(s). When a piece fails this check it is discarded (without being written to disk in most clients), and then automatically re-downloaded. Occasional hash fails can be ignored as a mild nuisance, while a large number of hash fails on a torrent can indicate a problem.</p>
            <p>Most clients are setup out-of-the-box to kick&amp;ban peers which repeatedly send them bad data, but if you're seeing more than a few hash fails on a torrent, you will probably want to ensure that the option is enabled in order to minimize download waste. The option/preference is generally listed as "kick/ban clients that send you bad data" or something similar. Enabling it will prevent peers from sending you an excessive number of corrupted pieces, as your client will automatically block them once they have sent you more than a certain number of bad pieces (usually 5).</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="45">How come I downloaded more on this torrent than its total size?</strong>
            <p>See the answer to the <a class="altlink" href="#44">hash fails question</a>. If your client receives bad data from one or more peers it will have to re-download the piece(s), and as a result your total downloaded for the torrent may be slightly more than the size of the torrent.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="110">What is a nuked torrent?</strong>
            <p>The text <strong>This torrent has been nuked!</strong> on a torrent means there is something wrong with it. Torrents get nuked by either the uploader or the staff. It can be anything: the disc has glitches when played, or is unplayable, or its specs to not match the specs given in its description, etc. There is usually a message in the description explaining what the problem is. If there is not, you can usually find that out by reading the torrent comments. Torrents with confirmed problems are sometimes deleted, but sometimes they are kept and nuked because the information relating to it can still be useful. If you come across a nuked torrent, there is most likely a good reason why you should not download it.</p>

            <strong id="1001">Is there "hit and run" on ADC?</strong>
            <p>There is no "hit and run" on ADC. But that doesn't mean you can drop the torrent as soon as you downloaded it. Recommended to seed until at least 1.5 torrent ratio or 45 days if there are are less then 5 seeds available. Members who repeatedly drop torrents immediately after download might get a warning.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="1002">What is a requirement on how many torrents and what size do I have to seed?</strong>
            <p>There is no specific requirements on the number torrents and size which you have to seed. The only recommended guideline is that you dedicate at least 5 TB of storage space for seeding ADC media.</p>

        <div class="fancy-container p-3">
            <strong id="71">Is there an easy way to search for a film, even if it has multiple English titles?</strong>
            <p>Yes! If you search for a film using the IMDb title number you will find any and all uploads on ADC for that film, even if the uploads are under different titles for the film. This works because the vast majority of torrents on ADC have an IMDb link, so it is very important to include the IMDb link when you upload a torrent.</p>
            <p>Once you've found the film on <a class="altlink" href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a> it is easy to determine its title number - all you have to do is look at the URL and grab the part that starts with "tt" and is followed by seven numbers. For example, the IMDb title number for <a class="altlink" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057565/">High and Low</a> is <strong>tt0057565</strong>. If you put that into the search box on <a class="altlink" href="<?php echo URL_ROOT . "/torrents"; ?>"> browse page</a> and tick the "Also search synopses &amp; descriptions?" checkbox, the search results will contain every upload of <em>High and Low</em> on ADC. This is very handy for those films with five or six English titles, as you can find all of them with a single search query.</p>
            <br>

            <strong id="73">What's the URL for the RSS feed?</strong>
            <p><a class="altlink" href="https://asiandvdclub.org/make_rss">https://asiandvdclub.org/rss</a></p>
            <br />

            <strong id="74">I downloaded something but didn't like it. Can I get the GB for it subtracted back out of my stats?</strong>
            <p>'Fraid not. One of the risks you take in downloading a torrent is that you won't like it, causing you to feel that you have "wasted" ratio which you could have put to better use downloading <em>that other DVD</em>. Well, thems the breaks. You win some, you lose some. If you have a ratio buffer, as any shrewd member would, getting burned on one or two DVDs won't really hurt you. Also, remember that no one - no matter how diverse their tastes - will like everything on a site with as varied a memberbase as ADC. So if you did not enjoy one torrent don't be afraid to give those other ones that look good a try. You may just find a new favorite film. Or maybe you'll pick another stinker. To sum this answer up in two words: <strong>caveat downloador</strong>.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="91">Every time I try to browse the torrents I just see a blank page. How do I fix that?</strong>
            <p>Go to your <a class="altlink" href="https://asiandvdclub.org/profile/ps">personal settings page</a>, uncheck all of the checkboxes next to where it says <strong>Browse default categories</strong>, and then click on the "Save settings" button. Now try visiting the <a class="altlink" href="https://asiandvdclub.org/torrents">browse page</a> again; it should display correctly.</p>

            <strong id="90">I thought ninjas were supposed to be badass. How come ninja clans are always getting annihilated in films?</strong>
            <p>This is due to the <strong><em>Law of Diminishing Ninjas</em></strong>, which states that up to three ninjas can be total badasses, but as the number of ninjas increases, each individual ninja in the group becomes less and less of a badass. Eventually you've got a clan of ninjas useless as anything other than cannon fodder.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4" id="6">How can I improve my download speed? - <a href="#top">Top</a></h2>
        <div class="fancy-container p-3">
            <strong id="50">Do not immediately jump on new torrents</strong>
            <p>The download speed mostly depends on the seeder-to-leecher ratio (SLR) on the torrent. Poor download speed is mainly a problem with new and very popular torrents where the SLR is extremely low.</p>
            <p>(Proselytizing sidenote: make sure you remember that you did not enjoy the low speed. <strong>Seed</strong> so that others will not endure the same inconvenience.)</p>
            <p>There are a couple of things that you can try on your end to improve your speed. In particular, do not do it if you have a slow connection. The best speeds will be found around the half-life of a torrent, when the SLR will be at its highest. The downside is that you will not be able to seed as much. It's up to you to balance the pros and cons of this.</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="51">Limit your upload speed</strong>
            <p>The upload speed affects the download speed in essentially two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bittorrent peers tend to favor those other peers that upload to them. This means that if A and B
                    are leeching the same torrent and A is sending data to B at high speed then B will try to reciprocate.
                    So due to this effect high upload speeds lead to high download speeds.</li>

                <li>Due to the way TCP works, when A is downloading something from B it has to keep telling B that
                    it received the data sent to him. (These are called acknowledgements - ACKs -, a sort of "got it!" messages).
                    If A fails to do this then B will stop sending data and wait. If A is uploading at full speed there may be no
                    bandwidth left for the ACKs and they will be delayed. So due to this effect excessively high upload speeds lead
                    to low download speeds.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The full effect is a combination of the two. The upload should be kept as high as possible while allowing the
                ACKs to get through without delay. <strong>A good rule of thumb is to keep the upload at about 80% of the theoretical
                    upload speed.</strong> You will have to fine tune yours to find out what works best for you.
                (Remember that keeping the upload high has the additional benefit of helping with your ratio.)
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are running more than one instance of a client it is the overall upload speed that you must take into account.
                Some clients limit global upload speed, others do it on a per torrent basis.
                Know your client. The same applies if you are using your connection for anything else (e.g. browsing or ftp), always think of the overall upload speed.
            </p>
            <br />

            <strong id="52">Limit the number of simultaneous connections</strong>
            <p>
                Some operating systems (like Windows) do not deal well with a large number of connections, and may even crash.
                Also some home routers (particularly when running NAT and/or firewall with stateful inspection services) tend to become
                slow or crash when having to deal with too many connections. There are no fixed values for this, you may try 60 or 100
                and experiment with the value. Note that these numbers are additive, if you have two instances of
                a client running the numbers add up.
            </p>
            <br />

            <strong id="53">Limit the number of simultaneous uploads</strong>
            <p>
                Isn't this the same as above? No. Connections limit the number of peers your client is talking to and/or
                downloading from. Uploads limit the number of peers your client is actually uploading to. The ideal number is
                typically much lower than the number of connections, and highly dependent on your (physical) connection.
            </p>
            <br />

            <strong id="54">Just give it some time</strong>
            <p>
                As explained above peers favor other peers that upload to them. When you start leeching a new torrent you have
                nothing to offer to other peers and they will tend to ignore you. This makes the starts slow, in particular if,
                by change, the peers you are connected to include few or no seeders. The download speed should increase as soon
                as you have some pieces to share.
            </p>
            <br />

            <strong id="55">Why is my browsing so slow while leeching?</strong>
            <p>Your download speed is always finite. If you are a peer in a fast torrent it will almost certainly saturate your download bandwidth, and your browsing will suffer. Most modern clients allow you to place limits on both the total download speed for all active torrents in the client, as well as the download speed for each individual torrent. You may improve your browsing experience by taking advantage of this capability. For best results you will probably need to test different values until achieve a good balance between your torrent download speed and your web browsing.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4" id="8">Why can't I connect? Is the site blocking me? - <a href="#top">Top</a></h2>
        <div class="fancy-container p-3">
            <strong id="62">Maybe my address is banned?</strong>
            <p>We block the addresses of users who were very naughty and got banned. This only occurs in cases of severe rule violation or other malicious activity. In rare cases, a user with a very dynamic IP address may discover that their ISP has assigned to them a new IP that was previously banned from ADC. However, unless you live in an area that has a lot of people who like to try to cheat on private trackers, you are quite unlikely to encounter such a scenario.</p>
            <p>If your address is actually banned from accessing the site, you will still be able to use low-level protocols like ping and traceroute to reach the server. Thus, if you have trouble accessing the site and you cannot ping it, the source of the problem lies elsewhere. But if you can ping the site but are unable to access it, your address may have been banned. Perhaps you were a very naughty user?</p>
            <br />

            <strong id="63">Your ISP blocks the site's address</strong>
            <p>In first place, it is quite unlikely that your ISP is blocking the site. Unless you're in China, as China does like to block access to ADC from time to time. The Chinese government doesn't like people being able to freely share information.</p>
            <p>The more likely culprits for an inability to access the site are problems with your DNS name resolution, your network, and/or how your local Internet connection is routed to ADC. There's nothing we can do in these cases since the problem is entirely outside our area of control. DNS and routing issues are usually temporary, assuming that your ISP is not terrible. If the problem persists, you should contact your ISP and ask them to fix it or simply switch to a better ISP.</p>

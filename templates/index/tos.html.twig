            <div class="fancy-container p-3">
                <p class="mt-0">Don't be put off by the legalities, but please read these terms and conditions of use carefully before using this website. This user agreement is needed mostly to make sure that our good deed of putting all this great stuff on the net goes unpunished, and to emphasize that publication rights are not being given away. "Look but don't touch."</p>
                <p>The goal is for you to enjoy viewing these treasures on the <a class="altlink" href="https://asiandvdclub.org">Asian DVD Club</a> website, not to keep them locked away out of sight, but theft of content from this website will seriously anger our generous uploaders who have allowed their rare and valuable collections to be displayed here and will put our entire project in jeopardy, so please contact us when we can be of help, or if you have ideas about how to do this better, but please don't get mad at us for only being able to let you see these wonderful torrents until you obtain permission for other use as we attempt to deal as best we can with technological limitations, legal requirements, and our need to pay the bills to keep this site open, and don't send us a rant without first reading our rants page.</p>
                <p>If you do not intend to be legally bound by these terms and conditions, please do not access or use this website. That said, let the contract begin...</p>

                    Courts have upheld the ability of content owners to restrict access to their digital works, flatly rejecting "free speech" and "fair use" arguments: "the Court expressed confidence in 'the likelihood ... that this decision will serve notice on others ... and thus contribute to a climate of appropriate respect for intellectual property rights in an age in which the excitement of ready access to untold quantities of information has blurred in some minds the fact that taking what is not yours and not freely offered to you is stealing.'" concluding " ... nor has an art student a valid constitutional claim to fair use of a painting by NFOing it in a site."<br />

                <p class="mt-0">We do not want, ask for, or need your private information, so it is your responsibility and we are relying upon you to select, configure, and operate your computer and networking equipment, operating system, Internet browser, e-mail and related software, etc. to protect your privacy and security generally to the extent that you prefer and to provide us only with information that you want us to have and use without restriction.</p>
                <p>We like to be able to give credit on this website for donated torrents or other content if donors let us know their full name and/or their website URL.</p>
                <p>Since third parties provide a variety of valuable services such as web hosting [Valueweb.net, & Comcast.net], server logs and site statistics, linked websites, hit counters (that also tell us which pages visitors prefer), searching the site's content and the web (from which we learn what subject matter visitors are seeking and what search methods are being used), fulfillment of book orders, etc., and we have little knowledge and no control over third-party's often inadequate and frequently changing privacy and security policies and practices (which unfortunately may not conform to their stated policies), we strongly recommend the following minimum general privacy and security measures (among others) which are not specific to this website, if and to the extent that you wish to maintain your privacy:
                <ol>
                    <li>use a proxy server that hides your actual IP address so that it does not appear in server log files;</li>
                    <li>if you enable cookies which many websites require to operate properly (but which we do not currently and never have used, but which are used by third parties), you should erase them at least daily;</li>
                    <li>use a browser that withholds the referring URL if you prefer this option;</li>
                    <li>use a hardware stealth firewall;</li>
                    <li>regularly use up-to-date virus checking, backup, and disk repair software;</li>
                    <li>use security software that attempts to detect and prevent surreptitious capture and transmission of personal identifiers such as names, user-id's or numbers, e-mail addresses, unique machine specific identifiers such as your computer's permanent ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) address or cookie stored GUID (Globally Unique Identifier), or your actual IP address,</li>
                    <li>use high grade encryption for all private, if not all communications;</li>
                    <li>never send confidential information or information not intended for publication using any e-mail link on this website;</li>
                    <li>be aware that e-mail addresses appearing on websites are subject to abuse by spammers; and, extremely important,</li>
                    <li>block all hosts that do not conform to your expectations of proper conduct.</li>
